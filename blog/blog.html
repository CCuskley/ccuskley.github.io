            </h4>
            <div class="text-cols">
              <p>It's been a rough few years for higher education in the UK. Widespread and <a
href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9387/" target="_blank">almost constant industrial action</a>, <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-64130367" target="_blank">pivots between online and in person teaching</a>, and <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/02/minister-rules-out-lifting-cap-on-student-tuition-fees-in-england" target="_blank">financial</a> woes for both students and
institutions. But among these looming systemic challenges lies a more
pernicious one: a precipitous drop in knowledge and skills related to
technology among university students, especially in the social sciences and
humanities.</p>
              <p>I teach programming, data analysis, and experimental methods in a school that is dominated by English literature. It is not something my students are necessarily expecting - many of them abandoned "hard" STEM subjects like mathematics and computing at the first opportunity, probably in their early teens. 20 years ago, many linguistics departments may have been more theoretical than anything else. Now, any competitive linguistics programme should provide students a certain level of data literacy, or at least offer them the opportunity for it. A linguistics graduate should be able to engage with quantitative methods at a fairly high level, at the very least as consumers, if not as producers, of primary research.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, when students sign up for my module titled "Experimental Methods in Linguistics" - which includes detail in the description that they will be learning and using the programming language R - they are often surprised by the content. In the first year I taught this module, a student was nearly in tears and informed me "they did not study English to do maths". Over the yeras, multiple students have asked if they need to “know how to use a computer”. When I ask for a novel experimental design with details about a recruitment strategy, I've had multiple students suggest they can  “post” an email to everyone in the university, indicating they see this as some kind of closed social network more like Facebook and less like a descendant of snail mail. When I tell students they will need to use a desktop computer to complete their assignments, I often get dismissive eyerolls [nutshell: they later concede]. Over the course of a few years, I've done a little typing test with my students just to see where they are - typing speeds below 30 words per minute with less than 60% accuracy are not unusual [NUTSHELL: as a comparison, a slow reader takes in about 100 words per minute].</p>
              <p>Some of this is purely the widening gap between me and my students: I am an 80s baby; my parents met when they were both programmers in the financial sector. There were computers in my house before there were computers in many houses, but my education in the US was also fundamentally different. I was drilled in touch typing with the now problematic Mavis Beacon[NUTSHELL] from about the age of 8, and I can now stare out a window while typing at around 80-90 words per minute with little loss in accuracy [NUTSHELL: I consider this a superpower]. I know my way around a computer, but  I don't  really remember being taught how to use one any more than I remember learning how to use a fork. It is something I just grew up with in the ambient atmosphere, and I absorbed <em>a lot</em>. I never really studied computers; I applied to university to do studio art and ended up in Psychology. It wasn't until years after my undergraduate, when I had to build my own interfaces for behavioural expeirments during my postgraduate studies in linguistics, that I began to program[NUTSHELL (at the time, R was barely a thing and Python wasn't either)]. I was able to google may way into programming in my mid-twenties in part because I <em>hadn't</em> been bottlenecked into a particular subject in my teens. No one was encouraging a girl who liked to paint to become a computer scientist, but no one was saying she couldn't mess around with code either</p>

            <p>In contrast, many of my students fled from "difficult" subjects in the sciences at the first opportunity. In England and Wales, that opportunity comes along when students are about 14-16, an age group well-known for their sound decision making and penetrating foresight. I'm not picking on a handful of students that don't get something: this is a critical mass indicative of a more widespread problem. I don't work at some impoverished institution with a reputation for under-prepared undergrads: I work at a Russel Group University with rigorous entry requirements [NUTSHELL: this is sort of the equivalent of a US R1, although dumber because some men invented it ina hotel in 1992]. My university also has a computer science programme: lecturers there do not encounter the same worrying anecdotes surrounding digital literacy that I do. As if there weren't enough axes of inequality surrounding technology, what we're seeing is a new one: science, engineering and medicine students "get" computers, while students in the humanities and social sciences avoid them. They do so to the point failures in basic in digital literacy, like knowing how to type or find a file on a computer. As a morbid upside, I worry about cheating using generative AI less than one might think: most of my student's, by their own admission, wouldn't know where to begin in using it. Most of them aren't even aware that my university has made the questionable decision of providing them with unfettered access to Microsoft Copilot (which uses GPT 4 for text generation, among other things).</p>
            <p> If we observe these failures in humanities students at university level, the issue is likely to be widespread, also affecting <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7857/#:~:text=The%20higher%20education%20entry%20rate,highest%20ever%20level%2C%20in%202022." target="_blank">the more than 60% of students in England who don’t go on to study at university</a>. University or not, basic digital literacy is something workers need: a <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/new-report-shows-digital-skills-are-required-all-types-jobs" target="_blank">2017 European Commission study</a> identified that more than 93% of all jobs require the use of a desktop or laptop computer. This extends beyond traditional office jobs and into areas of work like farming and construction. Correspondingly, almost all university courses – from mathematics to music – require students to complete essential coursework on a computer, from navigating a virtual learning environment to managing email and using a word processor.</p>
            <p>Because basic digital skills and literacy are not nationally assessed in England, quantitative data about what students actually understand about technology and how to use it by the time they leave secondary school is difficult to come by. We know what they are supposed to have been taught and understand: in England, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7cb981ed915d682236228d/SECONDARY_national_curriculum_-_Computing.pdf" target="_blank">Key Stage 3-4 Curriculum</a> requirements for computing – standards that supposedly every student should meet, regardless of their specific GCSE or A-Level subjects – are high:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Design, use, and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems.</li>
                <li>Undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals, including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users.</li>
                <li>Use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>How is it that the national computing curriculum is reminiscent of the job description for a senior data scientist, but my students <em>don't know how to find a downloaded file</em>? The computing curriculum was overhauled by Michael Gove as part of sweeping educational reforms in the early 2010s. This overhaul was supposed to occur in consultation with teachers, but it was eventually formulated predominantly by two professional organisations: the British Computing Society and Royal Academy of Engineering (Laura Larke, a researcher on educational policy, <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:32344f98-05e0-45ce-969a-f3cae46c3d6c/download_file?file_format=pdf&hyrax_fileset_id=maf05393f2b4f3055accaa216b2bf5d94&safe_filename=Larke%2B%282019%29.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article" target="_blank">provides a more detailed analysis here</a>). In short, it is not surprising that this new and improved computing curriculum sounds like a LinkedIn job posting: it was created by professional computer scientists, with limited input from primary and secondary educators on the ground. Consequently, its implementation has been patchy at best. Even putting crass <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html" target="_blank">government efforts at digital upskilling</a> aside, a 30-year-old ballet dancer probably knows how to use a desktop or laptop computer more effectively than most people now starting university at age 17-18 in 2025.</p> 
            <!--<p>Amid these curriculur reforms, the government has also concerned itself with the digital literacy of adults - an arena where professional societies should arguably dominate. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html" target="_blank">Pushes for 'upskilling' </a> arguably infantilize adults who chose to work in arts and culture rather than technology, but we still need a different approach for actual children. A 30-year-old ballet dancer probably knows how to use a desktop or laptop computer more effectively than most people now starting university at age 17-18 in 2024. An effective approach to getting this fictional dancer coding (if they even want to) must be entirely different to the approach we take with children.</p>-->
            <p>In all, these curricular reforms - which kicked in starting in 2013 - involved a typical conservative approach. Details of how to implement the ambitious curriculum were devolved to individual schools, without really considering what this would look like or cost, beyond <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/harmful-ict-curriculum-set-to-be-dropped-to-make-way-for-rigorous-computer-science" target="_blank">the vague notion that the private sector would somehow fill the void</a>. With a few computer scientists in every school to lend a helping hand, creating innovative and bespoke solutions for every student population, perhaps it would have been a resounding success. To some extent, the Department for Education has collaborated with the private sector to fill this void: the <a href="https://teachcomputing.org/" target="_blank">National Centre for Computing Education</a> (NCCE) provides training and resources for teachers. But the fact remains that it doesn't actually provide fully qualified computing teachers, a subject where there is a severe and growing shortage of primary and secondary educators in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/28/government-falls-short-on-secondary-teacher-recruitment-targets" target="_blank">a sea of widespread teaching shortages that span many other subjects</a>. </p>
            <p>The widespread impact of training resources for existing teachers is difficult to assess; <a href="https://static.teachcomputing.org/NCCE-Impact-report-2022.pdf" target="_blank">a report on the impact of the NCCE training initiatives</a> tells us how many teachers they trained, or focuses on A-Level Computer Science <em>outcomes</em>. Such outcomes are by definition from a biased - and dwindling - sample of students who continue on to relatively advanced study in the subject. <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2019/21-08-19-policy-briefing-on-teachers-of-computing.pdf" target="_blank">A 2019 Royal Society report</a> describes the reforms as leading to ‘computing provision [that is] ‘patchy and fragile’, particularly identifying a mismatch between teacher training and the content of the curriculum as a leading cause. Alongside this, uptake of computer science has tanked from 40% to 20% among girls at GCSE level, dropping to 9% at A-Level. Impact reports like this are all spin and sunshine, and cannot tell the story of what computing and digital literacy education <em>everyone</em> is getting. What does provision look like in schools with teachers who haven’t even been able to take up training from the NCCE? Particularly for key stages 1-4,  there is little guidance or oversight as to how the curriculum should be implemented, or even evaluation of whether it is meaningfully delivered at all. We simply don't have data about what the least common denominator for digital literacy is on the ground, but if</p>
            
              <p>Curiously, this runs counter to discourse about “ditigal natives”, which of course all young people are supposed to be. But digital natives don’t just happen, they develop through education. A barrage of data-science-oriented training might work for someone in their 30s, 40s, or 50s – they already know how to use a desktop computer. It’s not much use trying to teach this to a ten-year-old when we never taught them how to type. This would not be an effective strategy even if schools were adequately and uniformly resourced, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-review-series-computing/research-review-series-computing#assessment" target="_blank">which the government itself concedes they are not</a>.  Put simply, many professions may not use programming languages or algorithms, but they do use computers – and we aren’t teaching students how to do that, or how to figure it out for themselves as needed.</p>

            <div class="section-para">
            <p>Technology is a stereotypical example of <em><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.0712" target="_blank">cumulative cultural evolution</a></em>: thankfully, I don't have to learn how to build a computer in order to use a word processor. In using a word processor, I’m using a technological product that is the cumulative product of hundreds of years of technological advancement – none of which I need to understand for it to be useful to me. Cultural evolution on its own is the idea that a species can have socially learned behaviors that are passed down culturally, instead of being genetically inherited or individually learned – humans do this, but so do apes, dogs, and meerkats, among many others. The <em>cumulative</em> part is what many researchers believe is uniquely human, because it adds the capacity to build on earlier behaviors, accumulating complexity by expanding and improving them.</p>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Those of us born in the 80s and 90s grew up in the wolf-ridden wilds of internet forums and spreadsheets; people in their early 20s grew up in a sheltered smartphone house with golden retriever apps. Yet, the national curriculum, out of nowhere, describes a skill set associated with data science and web development. We are expecting modern children to somehow arrive ahead of where most of us ended up as adults, only without our very unique formative experiences. Replicate those experiences entirely isn't necessarily the point – aside from being impossible, it would be relying on the idiosyncrasies and intense investment of individual learning, rather than the potential of cultural accumulation. We want to take advantage of cumulative cultural evolution by replicating the <em>outcomes</em> of those experiences, so that we can build on them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              What are those outcomes, exactly? Nothing that is clearly reflected in the national curriculum for computing. The sum of the complex co-evolution of millennials, computers, and the internet is not “understanding key algorithms”, or “understanding how data of various types can be represented in the form of binary digits”.  The key outcome for “digital natives” is that basic skills about how to use a laptop or desktop computer beyond the browser (or figure out how to as needed, often using the internet), are second nature to us. Students entering university not only fail to meet the standards set out in the national curriculum, but they fail to meet these more basic “digitally native” criteria. There is not just a small gap between the national curriculum and what students know because the national curriculum is too aspirational (not to mention woefully under-resourced). There is an <em>ocean</em>: current students lack even basic skills that were seemingly second nature 5-10 years ago.</p>
              <p> We could hem and haw about teaching pivot tables, or how to use proper headers in a word processor; all things first-year students grasped upon arrival a decade ago (or quickly and independently acquired), and now often seem completely baffled by. These specific gaps aren’t so surprising – part of the curricular reforms led by Michael Gove around 2013 were spurred on by seemingly reasonable crituqes of the previous curriculum. According to <a href="https://milesberry.net/2018/01/computing-timeline/" target="_blank">a detailed timeline of the reforms by Miles Berry</a>, te previous Information Communication Technology (ICT) curriculum had become “devalued by students and employers due to a focus on relatively mundane, user-level skills”. The reforms would see these mundane skills supplanted by the National Computing Curriculum, with ICT exams at GCSE and A-Level being scrapped by 2018, replaced by Computer Science. Students starting their university studies in 2023 would have been finishing key stage 2 as the reforms were announced, starting stage 3-4 just as the more ambitious curriculum was rolled out. In other words, they may have never been taught the kinds of “mundane user-level skills” we previously took for granted at university level.</p>
              <hr>
              <div class="section-para">
              <p>Even if this were a simple case of the growing pains of educational reform – undoubtedly not helped by the pandemic - we could expect those pains to last a decade or more. But this is unlikely to be a transient problem without further reform. The 2013 curriculum seems to assume students will absorb basic digital literacy from the ambient atmosphere. Rather than pushing this to an earlier stage in the curriculum, the reform seems to have abolished “user-level skills” altogether and replaced them with a combination of “algorithms”, “two or more programming languages” and thin air. It leaps to teaching computer programming without ever teaching how to use a computer – a non-trivial task when many primary and secondary classrooms are full of touchscreen tablets, if they are fortunate enough to have digital devices at all.</p>
            </div>
              <p>We need to rethink computing skills as broader realms of understanding in terms of how technology works;  not just how to use it, but how to continually and independently learn and re-learn how to use it. This is particularly the case as computers seep into most aspects of our lives. This seepage is pervasive, in a way that even the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11828193" target="_blank">noted educational futurist Michael Gove</a> could not have imagined more than a decade ago. What we need is for students to understand why we might want a table that crosses two variables, or to organize sections and subsections of a text, and that computers are ideal tools for doing these kinds of things. In short, specific idiosyncratic strategies with particular software (or algorithms or programming languages) are beside the point; they potentially change too rapidly to matter. Modern children and teenagers are, in fact, “digitally native” – they are just native to devices like tablets and phones. Information often comes through these devices in the form of personalized notifications, messages, or recommendations. In other words, the information comes to them; the entire ethos behind recommendation algorithms is that if it is relevant, content will find you. What students need is a broader capacity for resilient information seeking and problem solving that give them the confidence to figure it out themselves, regardless of the software solution <em>du jour</em>. </p> 
              <p>Ultimately, this has the makings of a perfect storm of deepening divisions and inequalities in digital literacy, alongside a supply and demand death spiral not only for primary and secondary computing teachers, but also for the wider technology economy. Inadequate provision leads to inadequate general skills; this means only the motivated, well-resourced few pursue the subject at GCSE, A-level, and beyond. This leads to unmet demand for computing experts not just in teaching, but also in the for-profit sector – widening, rather than closing, the digital skills gap in the UK workforce. Perhaps we could climb out of this hole if computing provision were sufficient to provide a competent and uniform baseline of digital literacy; but inadequate provision leads to inadequate general skills. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
              <p>Computer science is already <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/gender-inequality-computer-science-early-elementary-school-years/159177/" target="_blank">overwhelmingly male</a>, <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/race-and-gender-trends-computer-science-silicon-valley-1980-2015" target="_blank">white</a>, and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/digital-divide-socioeconomic-disadvantage-computing-education/" target="_blank">more likely to come from generational wealth</a>. Much ink has been spilled about <a href="https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs60-women-in-science-2020-en.pdf" target="_blank">inequalities in STEM generally</a>, which includes computer science; almost none of it finds the idea of deepening these inequalities to be a morally or practically desirable one.  Nonetheless, the 2013 reforms have created conditions where the cumulative cultural evolution of digital literacy, skills, and computer science run through lines of inheritance dictated by gender, race and wealth disparities – deepening these disparities in the process.</p>
              <p>Digital literacy and understanding of technology are acutely important in the humanities – and acutely impoverished especially for students more likely to study these subjects. For example, it is essential journalists and creative writers to stay abreast of generative AI. Journalism is coming up against this technology in concrete ways. Google may have had <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/googles-ai-overviews-fail-at-fact-finding-but-excel-at-entertaining-and-other-ai-news" target="_blank">a bit of an oopsy when its AI overview told people to eat rocks and add glue to recipes</a>, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/25/google-revenue-quarter-one" target="_blank">profits were nonetheless soaring</a>. How many vital local news outlets <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspaper-closures' target="_blank">will close in the meantime</a>? An environment where humanities subjects at university level are forced to remove depth from their curricula to fit in basic digital literacy will help little. It’s the worst of all worlds: uneven basic digital literacy leads to a deepening of existing inequalities in technology, <em>and</em> a weakening of comprehensive university-level studies in the humanities and social sciences. Alongside existing divisions, we are creating a new class of digital literacy haves and have nots.</p>
              <p>A basic understanding of technology isn’t just important for the people we expect to build it; they certainly require a different depth of expertise, but that doesn’t mean the rest of us should be content with smartphones. We cannot acknowledge in one breath that a breadth and depth of technological expertise is a key aspect of modern adult life, and then in the next say it’s probably fine if many people don’t really know how to use it or how it works. Given the drastic changes to technology in the last two years – to say nothing of the last decade – reform of digital literacy and computing in the national curriculum is essential.</p>

On 15 August 2007, Nao replaced Sony's robot dog Aibo as the robot used in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL), an international robot soccer competition. The Nao was used in RoboCup 2008 and 2009, and the NaoV3R was chosen as the platform for the SPL at RoboCup 2010.</p>

            <p>This is an image of a skate, aligned to the left. It also has a small caption. For the floated image to look good, the surrounding text will need to be of a certain length. That's why I'm writing this filler text</p>
            <p>Typically one character is printed per keypress. The machine prints characters by making ink impressions of type elements similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The story was then told using a combination of oral narrative, music, rock art and dance, which bring understanding and meaning of human existence through remembrance and enactment of stories. People have used the carved trunks of living trees and ephemeral media (such as sand and leaves) to record stories in pictures or with writing. Complex forms of tattooing may also represent stories, with information about genealogy, affiliation and social status.</p>

              <p>"The art of narrative is, by definition, an aesthetic enterprise, and there are a number of artistic elements that typically interact in well-developed stories." &mdash; <code>.text-pull-right</code>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>With the advent of writing and the use of stable, portable media, stories were recorded, transcribed and shared over wide regions of the world. Stories have been carved, scratched, painted, printed or inked onto wood or bamboo, ivory and other bones, pottery, clay tablets, stone, palm-leaf books, skins (parchment), bark cloth, paper, silk, canvas and other textiles, recorded on film and stored electronically in digital form. Oral stories continue to be created, improvisationally by impromptu storytellers, as well as committed to memory and passed from generation to generation, despite the increasing popularity of written and televised media in much of the world.</p>

            <p>This is a center aligned image. It also has a small caption. The sky (or celestial dome) is everything that lies above the surface of the Earth, including the atmosphere and outer space. The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause of that intensity differs as well. </p>

            <p>When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated.</p>-->

            <p>Modern storytelling has a broad purview. In addition to its traditional forms (fairytales, folktales, mythology, legends, fables etc.), it has extended itself to representing history, personal narrative, political commentary and evolving cultural norms. Contemporary storytelling is also widely used to address educational objectives.</p>

            <p>Storytelling is increasingly used in advertising today in order to build customer loyalty. According to Giles Lury, this marketing trend echoes the deeply rooted need of all humans to be entertained. Stories are illustrative, easily memorable and allow any firm to create stronger emotional bonds with the customers.</p>
            <p>A Nielsen study shows consumers want a more personal connection in the way they gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when we read a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.</p>

            <p>Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. <strong>Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides</strong>. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation.
            </p>
            <p>Storytelling can be used as a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.</p>
