            <h2><strong>The rise and fall of digital literacy</strong></h2>
            <p><a href="https://ccuskley.github.io" title="Christine Cuskley"> Chrissy Cuskley</a>, November 2024</p>
            <p class="text-intro">
              How curricular reforms gutted basic computer skills, and why it won't get better anytime soon.
            </p>
            <p>It's been a rough few years for higher education in the UK. Widespread and <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9387/" target="_blank">almost constant industrial action</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-64130367" target="_blank">pivots between online and in person teaching</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/02/minister-rules-out-lifting-cap-on-student-tuition-fees-in-england" target="_blank">financial</a> woes for both students and institutions. But among these looming systemic challenges lies a more pernicious one: a precipitous drop in knowledge and skills related to technology among university students, especially in the social sciences and humanities.</p>
        
        <p>I teach programming, data analysis, and experimental methods in a school that is dominated by English literature. It is not something my students are necessarily expecting - many of them abandoned "hard" STEM subjects like mathematics and computing at the first opportunity, probably in their early teens. 20 years ago, many linguistics departments may have been more theoretical than anything else. Now, any competitive linguistics programme should provide students a certain level of data literacy, or at least offer them the opportunity for it. A linguistics graduate should be able to engage with quantitative methods at a fairly high level, at the very least as consumers, if not as producers, of primary research.</p>
        
        <p>Nonetheless, when students sign up for my module, they are often surprised by the content. It is titled "Experimental Methods in Linguistics", and there is clear detail in the description that they will be learning and using the programming language R. In the first year I taught this module, a student was nearly in tears and informed me "they did not study English to do maths". Over the years, multiple students have asked if they need to “know how to use a computer”. When I ask for a novel experimental design with details about a recruitment strategy, I've had multiple students suggest they can  “post” an email to everyone in the university, indicating they see this as some kind of closed social network more like Facebook and less like a descendant of snail mail. When I tell students they will need to use a desktop computer to complete their assignments, I often get dismissive eyerolls. Over the course of a few years, I've done a little typing test with my students just to see where they are - typing speeds below 30 words per minute with less than 60% accuracy are not unusual (<a href="#ReadingSpeed">:what is?</a>)</p>
        
        <p>Some of this is purely the widening gap between me and my students: I am an 80s baby; my parents met when they were both programmers in the financial sector. There were computers in my house before there were computers in many houses, but my education in the US was also fundamentally different. I was drilled in touch typing with the now problematic Mavis Beacon[NUTSHELL] from about the age of 8, and I can now stare out a window while typing at around 80-90 words per minute with little loss in accuracy [NUTSHELL: I consider this a superpower]. I know my way around a computer, but  I don't  really remember being taught how to use one any more than I remember learning how to use a fork. It is something I just grew up with in the ambient atmosphere, and I absorbed <em>a lot</em>. I never really studied computers; I originally applied to university to do studio art and ended up in Psychology. It wasn't until years after my undergraduate, when I had to build my own interfaces for behavioural expeirments during my PhD in linguistics, that I began to program[NUTSHELL (at the time, R was barely a thing and Python wasn't either)]. I was able to Google may way into programming in my mid-twenties in part because I <em>hadn't</em> been bottlenecked into a particular subject in my teens in the way that students are in the UK (and in England in particular). No one was encouraging a girl who liked to paint to become a computer scientist, but no one was saying she couldn't mess around with code either</p>

        <p>In contrast, many of my students fled from "difficult" subjects in the sciences at the first opportunity. In England and Wales, that opportunity comes along when students are about 14-16, an age group well-known for their sound decision making, penetrating foresight, and penchant for sticking with difficult things even if they may be slightly unpleasant in the moment. I'm not picking on a handful of students that don't get something: this is a critical mass indicative of a more widespread problem. I don't work at some impoverished institution with a reputation for under-prepared undergrads: I work at a Russel Group University with rigorous entry requirements [NUTSHELL: this is sort of the equivalent of a US R1, although dumber because some men invented it ina hotel in 1992]. My university also has a computer science programme: as far as I can gather, lecturers there do not encounter the same worrying anecdotes surrounding digital literacy that I do. What is going on?</p>

            <p>People share content that makes them feel inspired. WebSlides is free and open source. We built it because we need a platform for beautiful storytelling. Longform journalism has grown in popularity over the past several years, with blogs and media organizations including <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, <a href="http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>, and <a href="http://nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> creating or expanding longform coverage and new companies such as <a href="https://atavist.com/">The Atavist</a>, <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads.com</a> and <a href="https://longform.com/">Longform.org</a> being founded to capitalize on the new interest.</p>

            <p>Longform journalism is a branch of journalism dedicated to longer articles with larger amounts of content. Typically this will be between 1,000 and 20,000 words.</p>
            <p>Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values.</p>
            <p>Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.</p>
            <p>Storytelling predates writing, with the earliest forms of storytelling usually oral combined with gestures and expressions. In addition to being part of religious rituals, some archaeologists believe rock art may have served as a form of storytelling for many ancient cultures.</p>

            <p>Nao (pronounced now) is an autonomous, programmable humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics, a French robotics company headquartered in Paris. The robot's development began with the launch of Project Nao in 2004. On 15 August 2007, Nao replaced Sony's robot dog Aibo as the robot used in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL), an international robot soccer competition. The Nao was used in RoboCup 2008 and 2009, and the NaoV3R was chosen as the platform for the SPL at RoboCup 2010.</p>

            <p>The story was then told using a combination of oral narrative, music, rock art and dance, which bring understanding and meaning of human existence through remembrance and enactment of stories. People have used the carved trunks of living trees and ephemeral media (such as sand and leaves) to record stories in pictures or with writing. Complex forms of tattooing may also represent stories, with information about genealogy, affiliation and social status.</p>

            <p>With the advent of writing and the use of stable, portable media, stories were recorded, transcribed and shared over wide regions of the world. Stories have been carved, scratched, painted, printed or inked onto wood or bamboo, ivory and other bones, pottery, clay tablets, stone, palm-leaf books, skins (parchment), bark cloth, paper, silk, canvas and other textiles, recorded on film and stored electronically in digital form. Oral stories continue to be created, improvisationally by impromptu storytellers, as well as committed to memory and passed from generation to generation, despite the increasing popularity of written and televised media in much of the world.</p>

              <p>Facts can be understood as smaller versions of a larger story, thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking.

            <p>Modern storytelling has a broad purview.

            <p>Storytelling is increasingly used in advertising today in order to build customer loyalty. According to Giles Lury, this marketing trend echoes the deeply rooted need of all humans to be entertained. Stories are illustrative, easily memorable and allow any firm to create stronger emotional bonds with the customers.</p>
            <p>A Nielsen study shows consumers want a more personal connection in the way they gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when we read a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.</p>

            <p>Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. <strong>Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides</strong>. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation.
            </p>
            <p>Storytelling can be used as a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.</p>
