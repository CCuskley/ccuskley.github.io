		"fpSnippet":'<p>It\'s been a rough few years for higher education in the UK. Widespread and <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9387/" target="_blank">almost constant industrial action</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-64130367" target="_blank">pivots between online and in person teaching</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/02/minister-rules-out-lifting-cap-on-student-tuition-fees-in-england" target="_blank">financial</a> woes for both students and institutions. But among these looming systemic challenges lies a more pernicious one: a precipitous drop in knowledge and skills related to technology among university students, especially in the social sciences and humanities.</p> <p>I teach programming, data analysis, and experimental methods in a school that is dominated by English literature. It is not something my students are necessarily expecting - many of them abandoned "hard" STEM subjects like mathematics and computing at the first opportunity, probably in their early teens. 20 years ago, many linguistics departments may have been more theoretical than anything else. Now, any competitive linguistics programme should provide students a certain level of data literacy, or at least offer them the opportunity for it. A linguistics graduate should be able to engage with quantitative methods at a fairly high level, at the very least as a consumer, if not a producer, of primary quantitative research in the field.</p><p>Nonetheless, when students sign up for my module, they are often surprised by the content. It is titled "Experimental Methods in Linguistics", and there is clear detail in the description that they will be learning and using the programming language R. In the first year I taught this module, a student was nearly in tears and informed me "they did not study English to do maths". Over the years, multiple students have asked if they need to “know how to use a computer”.</p>'

			"fpSnippet":'<p>What is the connection between human language and how the human mind works? For cognitive scientists and linguists, the precise relationship between language and how we experience the world is still a matter of debate. The 2016 Denis Villeneuve film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)" target="_blank"><em>Arrival</em></a> tackles this question by introducing us to the alien Heptapods: a mysterious species that experiences the universe in a completely different way to humans. The film is an adaptation of Ted Chiang’s 1998 <a href=\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life\' target="_blank"><em>The Story of Your Life</em></a>, and both works explicitly tie the cognition of Heptapods to their language. How they communicate, the story goes, fundamentally shapes how their minds work - and even alters the minds of the humans who learn to communicate with them.</p><p>The proposal behind this is often known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, after anthropologists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee-Whorf. In a moment obscure theories rarely get, the idea is even name-checked in the film: the linguist protagonist, Louise (Amy Adams), mentions it in passing to her physicist colleague Ian (Jeremy Renner). This occurs just as she first starts becoming disoriented by her memories of the future - memories triggered by her rapid acquisition of the visual alien language, Heptapod B.</p>'
