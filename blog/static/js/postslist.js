		"fpSnippet":'<p>I spent the better part of my carreer teaching programming, data analysis, and experimental methods in the UK. This is not something my students are necessarily expecting - many of them abandoned "hard" STEM subjects like mathematics and computing at the first opportunity, probably in their early teens. Their expectations and perceptions about these topics - which all build on basic digital literacy - are both surprising, and revealing.</p><p>Once, a student was nearly in tears and informed me "they did not study English to do maths". Over the years, multiple students have asked if they need to “know how to use a computer”. When I tell students they will need to use a desktop computer to complete their assignments (i.e., you can\'t do it on a tablet, and definitely not on a phone), I often get dismissive eyerolls. Over the course of a few years, I\'ve done a little typing test with my students just to see where they are - typing speeds below 30 words per minute with less than 60% accuracy are not unusual'

			"fpSnippet":'<p>What is the connection between human language and how the human mind works? For cognitive scientists and linguists, the precise relationship between language and how we experience the world is still a matter of debate. The 2016 Denis Villeneuve film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)" target="_blank"><em>Arrival</em></a> tackles this question by introducing us to the alien Heptapods: a mysterious species that experiences the universe in a completely different way to humans. The film is an adaptation of Ted Chiang’s 1998 <a href=\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life\' target="_blank"><em>The Story of Your Life</em></a>, and both works explicitly tie the cognition of Heptapods to their language. How they communicate, the story goes, fundamentally shapes how their minds work - and even alters the minds of the humans who learn to communicate with them.</p><p>The proposal behind this is often known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, after anthropologists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee-Whorf. In a moment obscure theories rarely get, the idea is even name-checked in the film: the linguist protagonist, Louise (Amy Adams), mentions it in passing to her physicist colleague Ian (Jeremy Renner). This occurs just as she first starts becoming disoriented by her memories of the future - memories triggered by her rapid acquisition of the visual alien language, Heptapod B.</p>'
