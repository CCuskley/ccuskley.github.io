            <p>It's been a rough few years for higher education in the UK. Widespread and <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9387/" target="_blank">almost constant industrial action</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-64130367" target="_blank">pivots between online and in person teaching</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/02/minister-rules-out-lifting-cap-on-student-tuition-fees-in-england" target="_blank">financial</a> woes for both students and institutions. But among these looming systemic challenges lies a more pernicious one: a precipitous drop in knowledge and skills related to technology among university students, especially in the social sciences and humanities.</p>
          </div>
        
        <p id="readMoreStart">I teach programming, data analysis, and experimental methods in a humanities department. This is not sstudents are necessarily expecting - many of them abandoned "hard" STEM subjects like mathematics and computing at the first opportunity, probably in their early teens. In the first year I taught this module, a student was nearly in tears and informed me "they did not study English to do maths". Over the years, multiple students have asked if they need to “know how to use a computer”. When I tell students they will need to use a desktop computer to complete their assignments, I often get dismissive eyerolls. Over the course of a few years, I've done a little typing test with my students just to see where they are - typing speeds below 30 words per minute with less than 60% accuracy are not unusual (<a href="#ReadingSpeed">:what is?</a>)</p>
        
        <div class="section-para">
          <p>Some of this is purely the widening gap between me and my students: I am an 80s baby. My parents met when they were both programmers in the financial sector. There were computers in my house before there were computers in many houses, but my education in the US was also fundamentally different. I was drilled in touch typing with the <a href="#MavisBeacon">:now problematic Mavis Beacon</a> from about the age of 8, and I can now stare out a window while typing at around 80-90 words per minute with little loss in accuracy. I know my way around a computer. But I don't remember being taught how to use one any more than I remember learning how to use a fork. It is something I just grew up with in the ambient atmosphere, and I absorbed <em>a lot</em>. I never really studied computers; I originally applied to university to do studio art and ended up in Psychology. It wasn't until years after my undergraduate, when I had to build my own interfaces for behavioural expeirments during my PhD in linguistics, that I began to program. I was able to Google may way into programming in my mid-twenties in part because I <em>hadn't</em> been bottlenecked into a particular subject in my teens in the way that students are in the UK system. No one was encouraging a girl who liked to paint to become a computer scientist, but no one was saying she couldn't mess around with code, either.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In contrast, many current students in the UK fled from subjects they percieved to be "difficult", like math and science, at the first opportunity. At least in England and Wales, that opportunity comes along when students are about 14-16, an age group well-known for their sound decision making and penetrating foresight. I'm not picking on students who don't want a PhD in calculus &mdash; it's perfectly fine not to have a passion for persuing a subject professionally &mdash; but the minimum standard reached by UK students who choose not to persue these subjects sets a shockingly low bar. Many lack basic familiarity with the broadest strokes of the scientific method, and need first-principles-based instruction on things like how to calculate a proportion. Issues in digital literacy and numeracy are cut by lines like gender, race, and socioeconomic status, but this is a new one: these issues are starkly divided by subject.</p>

           <h3 class="text-context">Widening the gaps</h3>
        <div class="section-para">
        <p>As if there weren't enough axes of inequality surrounding technology, what we're seeing is a new one: STEM students are more likely to <a href="#GetComputers">:"get" computers</a>, while students in the humanities and social sciences avoid them. They do so to the point of failures in basic in digital literacy, like struggling to use a physical keyboard, or find a file on a computer. As a morbid upside, I worry about cheating using generative AI less than one might think: many humanities students, by their own admission, <a href="#LeftPropmt">:wouldn't know where to begin</a> in using it. While no doubt they will soon catch on, this is a harbinger. Even this technology that is supposed to be so intuitive and seamless that it will supposedly, inevitably, change the way we do everything is not within immediate reach for many humanities students, despite being <em>right there</em>.</p>
      </div>
        
        <p> If we observe these failures in humanities students at university level, the issue is likely to be widespread, also affecting <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7857/#:~:text=The%20higher%20education%20entry%20rate,highest%20ever%20level%2C%20in%202022." target="_blank">the more than 60% of students in England who don’t go on to study at university</a>. University or not, basic digital literacy is something workers need: a <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/new-report-shows-digital-skills-are-required-all-types-jobs" target="_blank">2017 European Commission study</a> identified that more than 93% of all jobs require the use of a desktop or laptop computer. This extends beyond traditional office jobs and into areas of work like farming and construction. Correspondingly, almost all university courses – from mathematics to music – require students to complete essential coursework on a computer, from navigating a virtual learning environment to managing email and using a word processor.</p>
        
        <p>Because basic digital skills and literacy are not nationally assessed in England, broad data about what students actually understand about technology and how to use it by the time they leave secondary school is difficult to come by. We know what they are <em>supposed</em> to have been taught and understand: in England, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7cb981ed915d682236228d/SECONDARY_national_curriculum_-_Computing.pdf" target="_blank">Key Stage 3-4 Curriculum</a> requirements for computing – standards that supposedly every student should meet, regardless of their specific GCSE or A-Level subjects – are high:</p>
        
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design, use, and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems.</li>
            <li>Undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals, including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users.</li>
            <li>Use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>How is it that the national computing curriculum shares some key elements wtih the job description for a data scientist, but humanities students often <em>don't know how to find a downloaded file</em>? The computing curriculum was overhauled by Michael Gove as part of sweeping educational reforms in the early 2010s. This overhaul was supposed to occur in consultation with teachers, but it was eventually formulated predominantly by two professional organisations: the British Computing Society and Royal Academy of Engineering (Laura Larke, a researcher on educational policy, <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:32344f98-05e0-45ce-969a-f3cae46c3d6c/download_file?file_format=pdf&hyrax_fileset_id=maf05393f2b4f3055accaa216b2bf5d94&safe_filename=Larke%2B%282019%29.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article" target="_blank">provides a more detailed analysis here</a>). In short, it is not surprising that this new and improved computing curriculum sounds like a LinkedIn job posting: it was created by professional computer scientists, with limited input from primary and secondary educators on the ground. Consequently, its implementation has been patchy at best. Even putting crass <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html" target="_blank">government efforts at digital upskilling</a> aside, a 30-year-old ballet dancer probably knows how to use a desktop or laptop computer more effectively than most people starting university in the latter half of the 2020s.</p> 
        
        <!--<p>Amid these curriculur reforms, the government has also concerned itself with the digital literacy of adults - an arena where professional societies should arguably dominate. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html" target="_blank">Pushes for 'upskilling' </a> arguably infantilize adults who chose to work in arts and culture rather than technology, but we still need a different approach for actual children. A 30-year-old ballet dancer probably knows how to use a desktop or laptop computer more effectively than most people now starting university at age 17-18 in 2024. An effective approach to getting this fictional dancer coding (if they even want to) must be entirely different to the approach we take with children.</p>-->
        <div class="section-para">
        <p>In all, these curricular reforms - which kicked in starting in 2013 - involved a typical conservative approach. Details of how to implement the ambitious curriculum were devolved to individual schools, without really considering what this would look like or cost, beyond <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/harmful-ict-curriculum-set-to-be-dropped-to-make-way-for-rigorous-computer-science" target="_blank">the vague notion that the private sector would somehow fill the void</a>. With a few computer scientists in every school to lend a helping hand, creating innovative and bespoke solutions for every student population, perhaps it would have been a resounding success. To some extent, the Department for Education has collaborated with the private sector to fill this void: the <a href="https://teachcomputing.org/" target="_blank">National Centre for Computing Education</a> (NCCE) provides training and resources for teachers. But the fact remains that it doesn't actually provide fully qualified computing teachers - and this is a subject where there is a severe and growing shortage of primary and secondary educators. That there's not much discourse about this specific shortage is unsurprising: it is but a drop in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/28/government-falls-short-on-secondary-teacher-recruitment-targets" target="_blank">a sea of widespread teaching shortages spanning many other subjects</a>. </p>
      </div>
        
        <p>The widespread impact of training resources for existing teachers is difficult to assess; <a href="https://static.teachcomputing.org/NCCE-Impact-report-2022.pdf" target="_blank">a report on the impact of the NCCE training initiatives</a> tells us how many teachers they trained, or focuses on A-Level Computer Science <em>outcomes</em>. Such outcomes by definition from a biased - and dwindling - sample of students who continue on to relatively advanced levels of digital literacy. <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2019/21-08-19-policy-briefing-on-teachers-of-computing.pdf" target="_blank">A 2019 Royal Society report</a> describes the reforms as leading to ‘computing provision [that is] ‘patchy and fragile’, particularly identifying a mismatch between teacher training and the content of the curriculum as a leading cause. Alongside this, uptake of computer science has tanked from 40% to 20% among girls at GCSE level, dropping to 9% at A-Level. Impact reports like this are all spin and sunshine, and are not as interested as they should be in telling the story of what computing and digital literacy education <em>everyone</em> is getting. What does provision look like in schools with teachers who haven’t even been able to take up training from the NCCE? Particularly for key stages 1-4 (up to about age 16),  there is little guidance or oversight as to how the curriculum should be implemented, or even evaluation of whether it is meaningfully delivered at all. We simply don't have data about what the least common denominator for digital literacy is on the ground. If the anecdata at university level is any indication, it has fallen off a cliff.</p>
            
        <p>Curiously, this runs counter to discourse about “ditigal natives”, which of course all young people are supposed to be. But digital natives don’t just happen, they <em>develop</em>. A barrage of data-science-oriented training might work for someone in their 30s, 40s, or 50s – they already know how to use a desktop computer. It’s not much use diving in trying to teach this to a ten-year-old - or even a 20 year old - when we never taught them how to type. This would not be an effective strategy even if schools were adequately and uniformly resourced, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-review-series-computing/research-review-series-computing#assessment" target="_blank">which the government itself concedes they are not</a>.  Put simply, many professions may not use programming languages or algorithms, but they <em>do</em> use computers and tools like word processing. Students seem to lack the basic skills to find their way around a desktop computer, because at least some of them seem to have never been taught.</p>

          <div class="wrap longform">
            <div class="section-para">
            <p>Technology is a stereotypical example of <em><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.0712" target="_blank">cumulative cultural evolution</a></em>: thankfully, I don't have to learn how to build a computer in order to use a word processor. In using a word processor, I’m using a technological product that is the cumulative product of hundreds of years of technological advancement – none of which I need to understand for it to be useful to me. Cultural evolution on its own is the idea that a species can have socially learned behaviors that are passed down culturally, instead of being genetically inherited or individually learned – humans do this, but so do apes, dogs, and meerkats, among many others. The <em>cumulative</em> part is what many researchers believe is uniquely human, because it adds the capacity to build on earlier behaviors, accumulating complexity by expanding and improving them.</p>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Those of us born in the 80s and 90s grew up in the wolf-ridden wilds of internet forums and spreadsheets; people in their early 20s grew up in a sheltered smartphone house with golden retriever apps. Yet, the national curriculum, out of nowhere, describes a skill set associated with data science and web development. We are expecting modern children to somehow arrive ahead of where most of us ended up as adults, only without our very unique formative experiences. Replicating those experiences entirely isn't necessarily the point – aside from being impossible, it would be relying on the idiosyncrasies and intense investment of individual learning, rather than the potential of cultural accumulation. We want to take advantage of cumulative cultural evolution by replicating the <em>outcomes</em> of those experiences, so that we can build on them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              What are those outcomes, exactly? Nothing that is clearly reflected in the national curriculum for computing. The sum of the complex co-evolution of millennials, computers, and the internet is not “understanding key algorithms”, or “understanding how data of various types can be represented in the form of binary digits”.  The key outcome for “digital natives” is that basic skills about how to use a laptop or desktop computer beyond the browser (or figure out how to as needed, often using the internet), are second nature to us. Students entering university not only fail to meet the standards set out in the national curriculum, but they fail to meet these more basic “digitally native” criteria. There is not just a small gap between the national curriculum and what students know because the national curriculum is too aspirational (not to mention woefully under-resourced). The space between what students know and this curriculum is an <em>ocean</em>: current students lack even basic skills that were seemingly second nature 5-10 years ago.</p>
              <p> We could hem and haw about teaching pivot tables, or how to use proper headers in a word processor; all things first-year students grasped upon arrival a decade ago (or quickly and independently acquired), and now often seem completely baffled by. These specific gaps aren’t so surprising – part of the curricular reforms led by Michael Gove around 2013 were spurred on by seemingly reasonable crituqes of the previous curriculum. According to <a href="https://milesberry.net/2018/01/computing-timeline/" target="_blank">a detailed timeline of the reforms by Miles Berry</a>, the previous Information Communication Technology (ICT) curriculum had become “devalued by students and employers due to a focus on relatively mundane, user-level skills”. The reforms would see these mundane skills supplanted by the National Computing Curriculum, with ICT exams at GCSE and A-Level being scrapped by 2018, replaced by Computer Science. Students starting their university studies in 2023 would have been finishing key stage 2 as the reforms were announced, starting stage 3-4 just as the more ambitious curriculum was rolled out. In other words, they may have never been taught the kinds of “mundane user-level skills” we previously took for granted at university level.</p>
              <hr>
              <div class="section-para">
              <p>Even if this were a simple case of the growing pains of educational reform – undoubtedly not helped by the pandemic - we could expect those pains to last a decade or more. But this is unlikely to be a transient problem without further reform. The 2013 curriculum seems to assume students will absorb basic digital literacy from the ambient atmosphere. This may have worked in the 90s when the atmosphere was heavy with it. But even then, they did still teach computing in schools, and computers were something you still had to learn how to use: they were not "intuitive". Rather than pushing basic digital literracy to an earlier stage in the curriculum, the reform seems to have abolished “user-level skills” altogether and replaced them with a combination of “algorithms”, “two or more programming languages” and thin air. It leaps to teaching computer programming without ever teaching how to use a computer – a non-trivial task when many primary and secondary classrooms are full of touchscreen tablets, if they are fortunate enough to have digital devices at all.</p>
            </div>
              <p>We need to rethink computing skills as broader realms of understanding in terms of how technology works;  not just how to use it, but how to continually and independently learn, re-learn and <em>figure out</em> how to use it. This is particularly the case as computers seep into most aspects of our lives. This seepage is pervasive, in a way that even the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11828193" target="_blank">noted educational futurist Michael Gove</a> could not have imagined more than a decade ago. What we need is for students to understand why we might want a table that crosses two variables, or to organize sections and subsections of a text, and that computers are ideal tools for doing these kinds of things. In short, specific idiosyncratic strategies with particular software (or algorithms or programming languages) are beside the point; they potentially change too rapidly to matter.</p>
              <p> Modern children and teenagers are, in fact, “digitally native” – they are just native to devices like tablets and phones. Information often comes through these devices in the form of personalized notifications, messages, or recommendations. In other words, the information comes to them; the entire ethos behind recommendation algorithms is that if it is relevant, <em>content will find you</em>. No need to look for anything, and thus, no need to know how to find things or figure them out yourself. Students are missing braoder capacities for resilient information seeking that give them the confidence to figure things out themselves.</p> 
              <p>Ultimately, this has the makings of a perfect storm. Deepening divisions and inequalities in digital literacy, alongside a supply and demand death spiral not only for primary and secondary computing teachers, but also for the wider technology economy. Inadequate provision leads to inadequate general skills; this means only the motivated, well-resourced few pursue the subject at GCSE, A-level, and beyond. This leads to unmet demand for computing experts not just in teaching, but also in the for-profit sector – widening, rather than closing, the digital skills gap in the UK workforce. Perhaps we could climb out of this hole if computing provision were sufficient to provide a competent and uniform baseline of digital literacy; but inadequate provision leads to inadequate general skills. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
              <p>Computer science is already <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/gender-inequality-computer-science-early-elementary-school-years/159177/" target="_blank">overwhelmingly male</a>, <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/race-and-gender-trends-computer-science-silicon-valley-1980-2015" target="_blank">white</a>, and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/digital-divide-socioeconomic-disadvantage-computing-education/" target="_blank">more likely to come from generational wealth</a>. Much ink has been spilled about <a href="https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs60-women-in-science-2020-en.pdf" target="_blank">inequalities in STEM generally</a>, which includes computer science. I've not seen any work in this area which argues that deepening these inequalities is a moral or practically desirable way forward.  Nonetheless, the 2013 reforms have created conditions where the cumulative cultural evolution of digital literacy, skills, and computer science run through lines of inheritance dictated by gender, race and wealth disparities – deepening these disparities in the process.</p>
              <div class="section-para">
                <p>Digital literacy and understanding of technology are acutely important in the humanities – and acutely impoverished especially for students more likely to study these subjects. For example, it is essential for journalists and creative writers to stay abreast of generative AI; these are the professions that these technologies are hitting the hardest. Google may have had <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/googles-ai-overviews-fail-at-fact-finding-but-excel-at-entertaining-and-other-ai-news" target="_blank">a bit of an oopsy when its AI overview told people to eat rocks and add glue to recipes</a>, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/25/google-revenue-quarter-one" target="_blank">profits were nonetheless soaring</a>. How many vital local news outlets <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspaper-closures' target="_blank">will close in the meantime</a>? An environment where humanities subjects at university level are forced to remove depth from their curricula to fit in basic digital literacy is unlikely to help. It’s the worst of all worlds: uneven basic digital literacy leads to a deepening of existing inequalities in technology, <em>and</em> a weakening of comprehensive university-level studies in the humanities and social sciences. Alongside existing divisions, we are creating a new class of digital literacy haves and have nots.</p>
              </div>
              <p>A basic understanding of technology isn’t just important for the people we expect to build it; they certainly require a different depth of expertise, but that doesn’t mean the rest of us should be content with smartphones. We cannot acknowledge in one breath that digital literacy is a key aspect of modern adult life, and then in the next say it’s probably fine if many people don’t really know how to use computers or bother to care how they work. Given the drastic changes to technology in the last two years – to say nothing of the last decade – reform of digital literacy and computing in the national curriculum is essential.</p>

          <h1>Reading Speed</h1>
          <p>As a comparison, speech is generally more than 150 words per minute, and slow reader takes in about 100 words per minute. A decent touch typist easily hits 70-80 words per minute with 90+% accuracy.</p>
          <h1>Mavis Beacon</h1>
          <p>"Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing" was a widely used software for learning touch typing in the 80s and 90s, at least in the US. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeking_Mavis_Beacon" target="_blank">A recent film, <em>Seeking Mavis Beacon</em></a>, reveals that Mavis Beacon was invented, and played by a Haitian woman named Renee L'Esperance who made about $500 for her trouble (in addition to being on the cover art, the entire "game" revolved around her likeness and character). The software made a whole lot of money, and people generally thought Mavis Beacon was a real person.</p>
          <h1>Russel Group</h1>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group" target="_blank">Russel Group</a> is kind of a UK equivalent of R1 universities in the US, generally percieved to be prestigious and research intensive. However, the word <em>percieved</em> is doing a lot of heavy lifting there: it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group#History" target="_blank">a completely made up thing invented in a hotel</a> (specifically, Russel Hotel) in 1994.</p>
          <h1>Get Computers</h1>
          <p>I do mean "get" in the sense of understand, but also literally as in <em>recieve</em>: many students in STEM related disciplines are given a laptop as part of their course of study, while students in the humanities are usually expected to have their own, or else use computing facilities on campus.</p>
          <h1>Left Prompt</h1>
          <p>Those that do use these tools, at least in my subject, are likely to do so quite gormlessly, e.g., forgetting to delete the prompt from their submission.</p>
