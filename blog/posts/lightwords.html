              <p>Language accomplishes a lot for us humans. Imagine something complex, like building a high-speed rail network. How would we do this without an intricate shared linguistic code? The structure in this code is often the focus of language research, but we forget how incredible simple words are. I can conjure an idea like <em>light</em> in my head - even in the darkness of night. I can encode it into a single word others share, and put that same idea in their head. Complex structure might be the high-speed train, but words are the wheels that came long before. </p>
            </div>
            <p>Words are a delicate agreement - a convention - shared across millions of language users. The sequence of sounds in the word <em>light</em> only refer to the kind of energy given off by the sun because we agree they do. Users of different languages have made very different bargains for words. For <em>light</em>, Basque speakers have agreed on <em>argia</em> and Hausa speakers on <em>haske</em>. In British Sign Language, light is a quick explosion of the fingers between the shoulder and face. Other human conventions on this scale take time, effort, and herculean top-down organisation; but words just happen. Where do they come from?</p>
            <div class="section-para">
              <p>If you search on the internet for the origins of a particular word like <em>glimmer</em>, you get an etymology. <em>Glimmer</em> is related to Old English <em>glæm</em>, the descendant of the proposed Proto-Germanic <em>*glim</em>, from the even older Proto Indo European <em>*ghlei</em>. The asterisk here means this form is hypothetical - we have no concrete record of Proto Indo-European or Proto-Germanic, so we no one can say for sure. We only have the language's modern daughters: English, German, Hindi, Irish, and many other languages spoken in Europe and throughout the world. Based on what we see in modern languages, we use informed conjecture to reconstruct ancient ones.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Etymologies tell us the story of how words come from other words, but little about where they come from in the first place. If <em>glimmer</em> comes from <em>*glim</em>, which came from <em>*ghlei</em>, where did <em>*ghlei</em> come from? For most words, we eventually hit a dead end. Human language is, at the very least, a few hundred thousand years old. New evidence shows it is perhaps much older. It may have emerged as early as a couple of million years ago, as a talent shared by our extinct hominid cousins, Neanderthals and Denisovans. But word etymologies can only go back thousands of years. If we're lucky, they take us to around 5-10,000 years ago, before we hit darkness.</p>
            <p>But words like <em>glimmer</em> provide us with an interesting light in this darkness. <em>Glimmer</em> has an unusual number of sibling words, which all have <em>gl-</em> in common, and all trace back to one source: <em>glint, glitter, glimpse, glare, glamourous</em> (the list could go on). Of course, it’s not uncommon for etymologically related words to share features. But they usually come in smaller clusters; <em>gl-</em> is both unusually prolific, and highly sensory, related to our experiences of light. If we think of words as competing for survival much like species do, <em>gl-</em> and light seem to have an unusual level of fitness. This might give us insights into how words emerged, how we started by tying them directly to our experience to launch them into widespread conventions.</p>
            <div class="section-para">
              <p>Many words don’t deal in sensory experience, instead carrying the heavy weight of abstract concepts, like <em>work</em> or <em>melancholy</em>. Yet, it’s likely that words dealing in sensory experience came first. Things we could touch, taste, hear, see and smell were very likely the first things we tried to share with each other. Indeed, <em>melancholy</em> is also a descendant of <em>*ghlei</em> via the Greek <em>kholera</em> (in English, <em>cholera</em>). Cholera was once believed to be caused by issues with bile: the glistening yellow liquid found in the gallbladder. This kind of etymology is illustrative of a common pattern: words which are grounded in sensory experience form the anchor for more abstract ones. This, in turn, allows abstract concepts to explode throughout our vocabulary. Once we’ve anchord a convention with our shared sensory experience, the vocabulary can grow and expand.</p>  
            </div>
            <p>The technical term for these <em>gl-</em> words is <em>phoneaestheme</em>, from the Greek <em>phon</em> for sound and <em>aesthesis</em>, meaning feeling or sensation. Phonaesthemes are so named because they seem to evoke sensory experience using sound in a way that words like <em>work</em> do not. But how they are tied to sensory experience is not clear. Words like <em>hiss</em> or <em>ribbit</em> (known as <em>onomatopoeia</em>) are also sensorily grounded. But their connection to their meaning is clearly one of the sound of the word resembling a sound <em>in</em> the world. Other languages take this further, by using words to represent sensory experiences in other modalities. Ideophones are words where sounds can resemble other sensory properties, like weight and motion. For example, in Japanese, <em>korokoro</em> is is a small object rolling, while <em>gorogoro</em> is a large object rolling.</p>
            <div class="section-para">
              <p>Exactly how sound is evoking sensory experience for phonaesthemes is an open question. They seem to be kindred with ideophones, but display trends that are more confined to specific language families. The cluster <em>gl-</em> seems to be tied to light predominantly in Germanic languages. This cluster must have taken a foothold from Proto Indo-European in Germanic in a way that it didn't elsewhere, for reasons we may never know. There is clearly something about the tie between <em>gl-</em> and light that makes these words especially successful. Whatever the reason, the descendants of <em>*ghlei</em> keep bubbling up in modern Germanic languages, permeating a range of languages from English to Swedish. We can only hope they stick around long enough for us to figure it out.</p>
