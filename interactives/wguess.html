Sometimes you were asked to guess between words that meant sweet and bitter, sometimes between black and white, and sometimes beetween colour and taste (like white and sweet). There is already evidence <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00593/full" target="_blank">people can guess the meaning</a> of antonyms like black and white in langauges they don't know. This project was aiming to test whether this holds for related but different terms (like sweet and bitter) and whether it works across modalities like colour and taste (black and sweet, for example). Data is still being analyzed, so stay tuned!</p>
