	        			<h3>What is The Void for?</h3>
	        			<p>The Void is for screaming into, both literally AND IN WRITTEN FORM. Unlike other voids, for example, the one you might find inside yourself before eating an entire pint of ice cream stuffed inside a pizza like its a giant taco, this one is completely safe. You can say whatever you want to it; it's a void, so no one will hear you. The Void is for everyone - you can scream into The Void instead of at software that isn't working, or about when that person somehow snuck ahead of you in line for coffee and you even said something but they had headhpones on and you weren't going to actually <em>touch</em> them, what are you, a monster??</p>
	        			<p>ANYWAY. The Void can also be used for more serious purposes - direct trolls who are full hateful garbage to The Void. The Void is ready for their bullshit. Screaming into The Void is much like writing something anywhere on the internet, except here no one will see it because it isn't stored or recorded, not because you have no followers.</p>
	        			<h3>Do I need to register for The Void?</h3>
	        			<p>No, just scream directly into it.</p>
	        			<h3>How does The Void work?</h3>
	        			<p>The Void uses sophisticated audio and visual technology to create the illusion of a bottomless hole on your screen, which may or may not be whistling with the depth of an endless abandoned mine depending on your audio settings. When you shout into it, your thoughts are released from your brain and into The Void, which goes nowhere.</p>
	        			<h3>Is The Void safe?</h3>
	        			<p>The Void is completely safe, secure, and GDPR compliant. The Void does not collect any information about you, nor does it store the screams (literal OR FIGURATIVE) that you pour into it. It's a void.</p>
	        			<h3>Who made the void?</h3>
	        			<p>The Void is eternal - it is everywhere and nowhere, and has been for all of time. However, this iteration of The Void was made by <a href="ccuskley.github.io" target="_blank">C. Cuskley</a>, while struggling to use an online manuscript submission system.</p>
	        			<h3>Where can I give feedback about The Void?</h3>
	        			<p>Any feedback on The Void, including ideas about the interface, design, implementation, and general concept, can be fed directly back into The Void itself, in written, spoken, or signed modality. It will never get back to you, nor will it change.</p>
